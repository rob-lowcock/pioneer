Pioneer is a retro board for running team retrospectives. There are 2 components:

* [github.com/rob-lowcock/pioneer-frontend](github.com/rob-lowcock/pioneer-frontend) - The frontend written in VueJS
* [github.com/rob-lowcock/pioneer-node](github.com/rob-lowcock/pioneer-node) - The backend written in NodeJS. It is a RESTful API that is used by the frontend to communicate with the backend.

Full instructions for set-up are included in the README files for the repositories.
